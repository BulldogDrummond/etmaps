Allied Intelligence have discovered a weapon research bunker outside of
the town of Braundorf.  It is the Allies mission to blow up the gas and
electricity control systems, causing overloads which will destroy the
facility.

The Allies must take the Braundorf Factory District and then attack the
Research Facility. The Axis must hold the Factory District as long as
possible and then mount a last ditch effort to defend the Research
Facility.

Time Limit: 20 minutes
