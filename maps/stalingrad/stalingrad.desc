The Axis have taken control over large portions of the Russian city of 
Stalingrad. In order to re-take the city, the Allies must gain control 
of a small neighborhood on the southern side of the city.  This area 
is a key strategic position, from which the allies hope to launch 
further missions deeper into the city.  Aware of the importance of this 
area, the Axis have placed two tanks within this area, which must be 
destroyed in order for the allies to secure the area. The Axis must 
defend these tanks in order to maintain their hold on the city.
