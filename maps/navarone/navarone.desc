The Axis are planning to execute over 2000 English soldiers on the
Greek island of Kheros. The Allied forces plan a rescue by sea, but to
do so, must sail past the island of Navarone. On Navarone the Axis
have two huge cannons inside a cliffwall with a shooting range of 200
kilometers. The Allied mission is to destroy the cannons from inside
the fortress in the cliffside. If they fail, many lives will be lost.
