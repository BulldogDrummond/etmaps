Civilians manipulated by the Volksempfanger's propaganda program are
resisting the Allied forces. To break the resistance, the Allies have
to take gain control of the Radio Transmitter, which is amplifying the
master signal from Berlin for local receivers. They must manipulate
the transmission-frequency by installing a Radio Modification Kit on
the Transmitter. The Allies also have to rotate the Antenna toward
the pirate sender to get the signal through.

Time Limit: 30 minutes
